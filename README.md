auto set syntax based on first line content, similar to https://github.com/jfcherng/Sublime-AutoSetSyntax

## Usage

- create a new file
- add something to the first line ex.`<?php`
    - if `onType` is enabled, adding a new line will set the syntax
    - otherwise, saving the document will set the syntax

## Notes

- for syntax check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers

## TODO

- [ ] get it to work on paste as well.
